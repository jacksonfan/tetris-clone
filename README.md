About the project
---

This is a tetris clone created using the program <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx">Atmel Studio 6.1</a>, drivers created by <a href="http://www.pocketmagic.net/atmega8-and-nokia-5110-lcd/">Radu Motisan</a>, and bitmaps generated using <a href="http://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/">LCD Assistant</a>

Bugs
---

* Blocks do not rotate
* Utilization of drivers inefficient, causing a long program period and thus slowing both the responsiveness of the game and rhythm of the music
* Completed lines will occasionally remove too many blocks
